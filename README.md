# Jama-Software

## Developing

After cloning the repo run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies.

If it doesn't already exist in your environment, create a new `.env` file in
the project root directory, copying `.env.example` and modifying as necessary
for the environment. (**Change the `SESSION_SECRET`!**)

Then, to run and debug the app use `npm run debug`.
