## Developing

After cloning the repo run `npm install` to install the app's dependencies.

If it doesn't already exist in your environment, create a new `.env` file in
the project root directory, copying `.env.example` and modifying as necessary
for the environment. (**Change the `SESSION_SECRET`!**)

Then, to run and debug the app use `npm run debug`.

## Testing

Unit testing using Mocha and Chai:
 Make sure to do an 'npm install' to install the new dependencies. To use Mocha, you would write your scripts in the test folder and then run the specific script by typing 'mocha script.js' or 'mocha script' to run it.
